The new plugins will not work with the system before 8.0, so if you just got plugins and your installation is old, you must update your site. 

# If you have updated your site to version 8.0, your old plugins will not work, just download them again and you should be fine.

# First thing...
I would humbly like to thank God for giving me the necessary knowledge, motivation, resources and idea to be able to execute this project. Without God's permission this would never be possible.

**For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.**
`Apostle Paul in Romans 11:36`

# This Software must be used for Good, never Evil. It is expressly forbidden to use AVideo to build porn sites, violence, racism or anything else that affects human integrity or denigrates the image of anyone.

# Now you can read the rest...

## Important Information

> Streamer can be installed on any Server, including Windows, but the encoder and Livestream should work fine on any Linux distribution. However we recommend Ubuntu 16+ without any kind of control panel.
> The problem with cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, etc. It's because we need full root access to install some libs, and maybe compile them. Another important point is that to make Livestream work, we need to compile Nginx and the control panels often prevent us from running the commands forcing the installation available only on your panel.

I donÂ´t want to read I just want you to show me how to install!!

# AVideo - Streamer
AVideo! is an video-sharing website, It is an open source solution that is freely available to everyone. With AVideo you can create your own video sharing site, AVideo will help you import and encode videos from other sites like Youtube, Vimeo, etc. and you can share directly on your website. In addition, you can use Facebook or Google login to register users on your site. The service was created in march 2017.

</div>

# Why do I need the Encoder?
You may want to install the encoder for a few reasons, such as, if you have a faster server than the public encoder server (which is likely to be the case), or if you'd like a private way of encoding your videos.

But, the installation is mandatory if you are using a private network. The public encoder will not have access to send the videos to your streamer site.

If your server does not have a public IP or uses an IP on some of these bands:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 127.0.0.0/8 (Localhost)
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Surely you need to install an encoder

# What is new on this version 4.0?
Since version 4.x+ we separate the streamer website from the encoder website, so that we can distribute the application on different servers.
- The Streamer site, is the main front end and has as main function to attend the visitors of the site, through a layout based on the youtube experience, you can host the streamer site in any common internet host can host it (Windows or Linux).
- The Encoder site, will be better than the original encoder, the new encoder will be in charge of managing a media encoding queue. You can Donwload the encoder here: https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo-Encoder. but to install it you will need ssh access to your server, usually only VPS servers give you that kind of access, that code uses commands that use the Linux shell and consume more CPU.
- I will have to install the encoder and the streamer?
No. We will be providing a public encoder, we will build the encoder in such a way that several streamers can use the same encoder. We are also providing source code for this, so you can install it internally and manage your own encoding priority.
